# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Warehouse
The repository is a personal collection of the various algorithms and data structures that I have come across so far. It may be more useful for those who have already had a go with DSA previously as mainly the non-basic ones are covered here.

### Index

### How to contribute
- Mark an issue with details of the algorithm that you wish to contribute. The issue should have a proper description and should provide the user a good idea of what you intend to do.
- A maintainer will assign the issue to you.
- Once assigned, either fork the repo or make a new branch in the current working repo
- Commit your changes and create a pull request. Request for review from a maintainer
- If the maintainer finds scope for improvements, he or she will mention them in the comment section under the PR. Otherwise the PR will be merged

### General Guidelines
- All programming languages are welcome.
- You can contribute either by writing the documentation or by providing problems which have not been covered.
- In case of problems, interview based problems will be preferred. Also only parent problems shall be taken and problems that can be solved using a given parent problem will only be added as a link in the parent problem
- The repo intends to become a resource with about everything that one would need in DSA.
